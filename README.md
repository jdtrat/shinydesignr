The goal of shinydesignr is to make designing visually appealing Shiny user interfaces (UIs) easier. Our package provides a high-level GUI for rapid prototyping user interfaces whose back-end CSS and Shiny UI code can be downloaded. We also provide lower-level functions for designing Shiny UIs in a manner analogous to [Bootstrap grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) but with more human-friendly nomenclature.
